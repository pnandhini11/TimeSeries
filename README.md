# TimeSeries

This repository will start from SingleExponentialSmoothing Technique for Forecasting which will then be expanded to Double and Triple exponential smoothing which is otherwise called as Holt-Winter's Method.  Then will move to Box-Jenkins Method is otherwise called as ARIMA model.  And finally end with LSTM Model for forecasting. 

What is SingleExponenitalSmoothing Technique? Why do we start from here for Time Series? 

When I tried to understand the statistics behind forecasting using time series data, usually we directly go to ARIMA model which is the best and widely used Time Series Model. I was not very convincing why do we use ARIMA model which is basically (AR) - AutoRregressive, (I) - Differencing , (MA) - Moving Average. What is AutoRegressive? What is Moving Average? Don't we have any other way to forecast why ARIMA is more popular beside LSTM?  I decided to try out from simple way of predicting the time series using simple calculation using past data. 
Here I am with this repository and Jupyter Notebook with Monthly Sales data.  Using these I want to try out options and show the differences or improvement each method gives.
